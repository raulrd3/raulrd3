### Hi, I'm Raul! ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm an iOS Developer passionate about problem solving and collaboration to craft great end-user experiences.
<br>
<br>
After working as a psychotherapist for the last 3 years, I'm looking for an iOS Developer role.  My clinical skills translate well into technical problem solving as I have experience assessing, diagnosing, and treating client concerns within an interdisciplinary team.  My background in mental health also gives me a unique insight into how people interact with products and the kind of experiences they are looking for.
